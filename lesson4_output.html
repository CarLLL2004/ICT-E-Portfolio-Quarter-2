    <h2>Lesson 4 - CSS Rules</h2>
    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
    <p> <b>CSS Rule</b><br>
        A CSS rule has two main parts: <b>selector</b> and one or more <b>style declarations</b>.<br>
        Inline styles are written inside the tag, while document-level and external style sheets use selectors and declarations separately.<br><br>

        <b>Style Properties</b><br>
        Properties are grouped into six:<br>
        <i>1. Fonts</i><br>
        <i>2. Colors and backgrounds</i><br>
        <i>3. Text</i><br>
        <i>4. Boxes and layout</i><br>
        <i>5. Lists</i><br>
        <i>6. Tag classifications</i><br><br>

        <b>Classes</b><br>
        A class is a user-defined selector used to apply style rules to specific elements.<br>
        It can control individual element formatting and is reusable across multiple elements.<br>
        Classes are defined by a dot and can be written with or without an element name.<br>
        A class must be called in the HTML file using the <i>class</i> attribute to apply its style.<br>
        One element can have more than one class, and one class can be applied to many elements.<br>
        Classes allow consistency and flexibility.<br><br>

        <b>Class Selector</b><br>
        Element + class selectors apply styles only when both the element and class match.<br>
        Class selectors can be reused across elements, while element + class selectors are more specific.<br>
        <i>.classname ‚Üí applies to any element with that class</i><br>
        <i>element.classname ‚Üí applies only to that specific element type</i><br><br>

        <b>External and Internal CSS</b><br>
        Internal CSS uses style rules inside the HTML file, while external CSS uses a linked stylesheet.<br>
        Classes can be applied to many elements for a consistent design across the page.<br><br>

        <b>Grouping Selectors</b><br>
        Multiple selectors can be combined using commas to make the code shorter and cleaner.<br>
        This is useful for applying the same style to different elements without repeating rules.<br></p>

    <ul>
        <li><img src="images/L4s.png" width="300"></li>
         <li><img src="images/L4ss.png" width="300"></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>This lesson gave me an idea on how selectors and declarations work along CSS. It also taught me how to use classes to style a group of elements or a specific element and use it multiple times. Overall, this lesson is another stepping stone in improving my knowledge about CSS.</p>
