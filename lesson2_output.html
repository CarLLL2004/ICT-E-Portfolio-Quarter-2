    <h2>Lesson 2 - Types of CSS</h2>
    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
    <p>
<b>What will we use in CSS?</b><br>
‚Ä¢ Curly braces { }<br>
‚Ä¢ Semi Colons ;<br>
‚Ä¢ Selectors<br>
‚Ä¢ Declarations<br><br>

<b>Structure of CSS</b><br>
Structure of CSS<br>
‚Ä¢<i>Selector</i> ‚Äì the HTML element you want to style;  is a pattern used to "find" or "select" the HTML elements on a webpage to which a set of CSS rules will be applied.<br>
‚Ä¢<i>Property</i> ‚Äì the style attribute you want to modify; is a named characteristic or attribute that defines a specific aspect of how an HTML element should be displayed or rendered by the browser. Properties are used within CSS declarations to apply styles to selected elements.<br>
Structure of CSS<br>
‚Ä¢<i>Value</i> ‚Äì the weight of the attribute you want to apply to the element property; is the specific setting or configuration assigned to a CSS property. A property and its value form a CSS declaration, which dictates how an element should be styled<br>
‚Ä¢<i>Declaration</i> ‚Äì is a single instruction that defines a specific style for an element<br>
‚Ä¢<i>Declaration block</i> ‚Äì fundamental part of a CSS rule. It is a block of code that contains one or more CSS declarations, which define the styling rules for the selected HTML element(s).<br><br>

<b>The Style Sheet and its Parts</b><br>
‚Ä¢ A set of instructions to a Web browser on how to display various elements on a Web page is known as style sheet.<br>
‚Ä¢ Every CSS (whether it is contained in a .css file, or embedded in the head element of an HTML document) is a series of instructions called statements<br>
The statement does two things:<br>
‚Ä¢ It identifies the elements in an HTML document that it affects.<br>
‚Ä¢ It tells the browser how to draw these elements.<br>
Elements are considered to be paragraphs, links,  lists items, and so on. In technical terms HTML terms, an element is anything marked up inside HTML tags.<br><br>

<b>How Do Style Sheet Work?</b><br>
‚Ä¢Style sheets are just text files, or text embedded in the head of an HTML document, that help separate content from appearance. <br> The content of the page goes into an HTML file. And the appearance goes into a style sheet. But how does all this end up as a web page in the reader‚Äôs browser?<br>
‚Ä¢A style sheet suggests the browser to display a page in a particular way, how the pages should be displayed in the browser.<br>
There are two things that you should remember when using the CSS code:<br>
1. The type attribute should always be &lt;style type=‚Äútext/css‚Äù&gt;.<br>
2. CSS code should be enclosed in HTML comments &lt;!--‚Ä¶--&gt; so that in a web browser that does not understand CSS, the browser will not see the CSS code.  But today, however, all current browsers support CSS.<br><br>

<b>Three Kinds of CSS</b><br>
<b>External Style Sheets</b><br>
‚Ä¢ the most global of the three kinds of CSS because you can apply the same one to an unlimited number of pages<br>
‚Ä¢ allows you to develop a consistent style across pages<br>
‚Ä¢ easily allow you to change the layout of your entire web site by simply changing the external style sheet and every page is instantly updated<br>
‚Ä¢ has a .css file extension<br><br>

<b>Embedded Style Sheets (Internal Style Sheets)</b><br>
‚Ä¢ used for creating a document-wide style rule<br>
‚Ä¢ placed within an HTML document, between the &lt;head&gt; and &lt;/head&gt;<br>
‚Ä¢ used when you have a page that you want to present in a different style from other pages<br>
‚Ä¢ embedded style sheets override external style sheets<br><br>

<b>Inline Style Sheets</b><br>
‚Ä¢ used for isolated changes to a headline, paragraph, picture or other element<br>
‚Ä¢ stored directly in the style attributes of the HTML tags<br>
‚Ä¢ inline style sheets override external and embedded style sheets<br><br>

<b>Syntax of the three kinds of CSS</b><br>
(Examples)<br>
<b><i>External Style Sheet</i></b><br>
&lt;link rel=‚Äústylesheet‚Äù href=‚Äústyle.css‚Äù type=‚Äútext/css‚Äù&gt;<br>
Filename of the external file<br>
<b><i>Embedded Style Sheet</i></b><br>
&lt;style type=‚Äútext/css‚Äù&gt; &lt;/style&gt;<br>
<b><i>Inline Style Sheet</i></b><br>
&lt;p style=‚Äúbackground-color:violet;‚Äù&gt;<br><br>

<b>Embedded Style Sheet</b><br>
Embedded styles or Internal style sheets are defined by the container tag &lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt; and placed within the head part of the HTML file.  It provides style to the whole HTML file.<br> <br>

<b>Linked Style Sheets</b><br>
‚Ä¢ External style sheets or linked styles are made outside the HTML file.<br>
‚Ä¢ An external style sheet is linked via &lt;link&gt;.  The &lt;link&gt; element allows you to establish document relationships.<br>
‚Ä¢ The &lt;link&gt; element tells the browser to find the specific style sheet.<br>
‚Ä¢ The &lt;link&gt; element can ONLY be used within the &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; section of the document.<br>
‚Ä¢ The style sheet file does not contain ANY html code;  it contains only style rules.<br>
‚Ä¢ A CSS file (filename.css) is a style sheet that does not contain anything but the styles.<br>
‚Ä¢ In order for it to take effect, it needs to be linked.<br>
‚Ä¢ A linked file is simply just like embedded styles but without all the HTML tags.<br>
‚Ä¢ Can be written in any text editor and saved with a filename extension of .css.<br>
‚Ä¢ Using the external/linked style sheets, we can modify web pages by just changing one CSS file.<br><br>

<b>Creating an External CSS file</b><br>
The following steps will show how to create and test a basic style sheet.<br>
1. Open a blank document in Notepad.<br>
2. Type the style you want to define.<br>
3. On the Menu bar, click File and click Save.<br>
4. Type your filename with the extension .css and change the file type to All Files.<br><br>

<b>Linking CSS file to HTML file</b><br>
1. After creating your CSS file, open your HTML file.<br>
2. Type the following inside the HTML file:<br>
&lt;link rel=‚Äústylesheet‚Äù href=‚Äúsample.css‚Äù type=‚Äútext/css‚Äù&gt;.<br>
3.  Save your HTML file.<br> <br>

<b>CSS Comments</b><br>
Comments are used to explain the code, and will help you edit the source code on a later date.  <br>
Comments are ignored by the browsers, therefore you can place notifications, reminders and help you increase code readability.  <br>
A CSS comment starts with /* and ends with */.   <br>
Comments can also span multiple lines.<br>

    <h3>My Browser Output</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><img src="images/ss2.jpg" width="300" class="heyo"></li>
        <li><img src="images/ss2.2.jpg" width="300" class="heyo" ></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>Here, I learned about the 3 types of CSS ‚Äî External, Embedded/Internal, and Inline, and how each one affects a webpages layout when used. It also showed be the basic syntax for CSS, which includes selectors, properties, values, and declarations. Overall, I realized the importance in learning these fundamental concepts in developing my understanding of CSS.</p>
