    <h2>Lesson 1 - Introduction to CSS</h2>
    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
    <p>Here I learned about: <br> <br>

        <b>What is CSS?</b><br>
‚Ä¢ CSS stands for <b>Cascading Style Sheets</b><br>
‚Ä¢ CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.<br>
‚Ä¢ CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once<br>
‚Ä¢ External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.<br>
‚Ä¢ CSS is the language we use to style a Web page.<br>
‚Ä¢ CSS separates content from design, making websites easier to maintain and more attractive.<br><br>

<b>Why use CSS?</b><br>
‚Ä¢ CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.<br>
‚Ä¢ Provides consistency across web pages.<br>
‚Ä¢ Saves time: one CSS file can control multiple pages.<br>
‚Ä¢ Improves accessibility and responsiveness.<br>
‚Ä¢ Enhances design with layout, colors, and animations.<br><br>

<b><i>Just like how the elements of the human body were layered and placed on top of each other‚Äìbones, muscles, veins, etc., to become a whole, the web page is also composed of layers to make it whole.</i></b><br><br>

<b>The layers of a webpage:</b><br>
3. Behavior Layer<br>
2. Presentation Layer<br>
1. Content Layer<br><br>

Each layer of the webpage has its specific use or function in the web page. Each plays an important role to be able to attain the goal or objective of a particular website.<br><br>

<b>Content Layer</b><br>
The content layer is where you:<br>
* define and layout the text, images, animation, sound, video and everything you want to put in a web page with the use of tags<br>
* is the underlying HTML code of that page. Just as a house's frame creates a strong foundation upon which the rest of the house is built, a solid foundation of HTML creates a platform upon which a website can be created<br><br>

<b>Content Layer needs to have:</b><br>
‚Ä¢ Text that is easy to understand.<br>
‚Ä¢ Text that makes sense without a visual representation (wrong example: ‚Äúclick on the links below‚Äù)<br>
‚Ä¢ Alternative text for every image, sound piece or video that is content<br>
‚Ä¢ Text that is fit for the web (KISS, structured into headers, paragraphs and lists)<br>
‚Ä¢ Explanations of Acronyms and Abbreviations<br>
‚Ä¢ Content images need to be unambiguous for the colorblind and text in images needs to have a sufficient size and contrast.<br>
‚Ä¢ Information to the users of changes necessary to her environment (example: ‚Äúopens in a new window‚Äù or ‚ÄúPDF document, 182kb‚Äù)<br><br>

<b>Presentation Layer</b><br>
The presentation layer is where you can define how people see your web page in a browser.<br><br>

<b>Presentation Layer needs to:</b><br>
‚Ä¢ ensure that text can be zoomed without making the site unusable<br>
‚Ä¢ ensure that the interactive elements of the site are easy to find<br>
‚Ä¢ ensure that images and foreground and background have enough contrast and are unambiguous to the colorblind<br>
‚Ä¢ give the site a consistent navigation<br>
‚Ä¢ aid the user through business processes<br>
‚Ä¢ separate content into easily understandable units<br><br>

<b>Behavior Layer</b><br>
The behavior layer is where you have a real-time user interaction with the web page. The interaction may be simple validation of input or filling out a form or even as big as web-based programs.<br><br>

<b>Behavior Layer needs to:</b><br>
‚Ä¢ ensure that all the functionality is available to the user regardless of input device<br>
‚Ä¢ make the user experience as easy as possible by cutting down on options until they are necessary<br><br>

In comparison, HTML is used to create the actual content/foundation of the page and CSS is responsible for the design or style of the website, including the layout, visual effects and background color.<br><br>

<b>Benefits of using CSS</b><br>
CSS saves a lot of work<br>
You do not have to code the CSS repeatedly into an HTML file. You just need to write the CSS code once and then reuse the same stylesheet in multiple HTML pages. This saves coding time and space of your hard disk.<br><br>

<b>Easy maintenance</b><br>
You can control the look and layout of several HTML pages at once.<br>
Adding style to webpage makes it more pleasing to the eye<br>
Improve the appearance of a website by allowing you to create a much more stylish website since CSS offers a wide array of expressive style capableness.<br><br>

<b>Capabilities of CSS</b><br>
1. CSS makes your pages easily updateable. CSS makes it possible to update the layout of the entire page quickly. You can specify a style once and you can apply it as many times in your document.<br>
2. Position objects on the page. CSS gives you control when placing objects on the page exactly where you want them.<br>
3. Layer objects on the page. CSS allows you to position objects in three dimensions.<br>
4. Create custom tags. CSS allows you to create custom tags to achieve specialized objectives.<br><br>

<b>Advantages of using CSS</b><br>
1. Save typing and development time because you have to enter CSS code only once and it can be applied to many HTML scripts.<br>
2. Download faster because your browser will download only one file once.<br>
3. Faster page loading.<br>
4. You can also have multiple link tags in one document.<br>
5. Better design flexibility.<br>
6. Easier to maintain and update.<br>
7. Separation of structure (HTML) and style (CSS).<br><br>

<b>Prerequisites to learning CSS</b><br>
You should have a basic knowledge and understanding of HTML or XHTML to continue learning CSS.<br>
    <h3>My Browser Output</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><img src="images/ss1.jpg"  class="heyo"></li>
        <li><img src="images/ss1.1.jpg"  class="heyo"></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>Here, I learned about the importance of using CSS in designing and styling webpages effectively. It deepened my understanding about the separation of CSS from HTML therefore making work much more easier and saving more time when doing your codes. It also showed me how CSS can make your webpage visually appealing and responsive, therefore helping me realize how CSS can serve as your foundation in creating user-friendly designs and webpage.</p>
